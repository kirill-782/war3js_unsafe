You can use the same technique to attach\nother information like the trackables position, facing, etc.\n\n@note See `CreateTrackable` for a way to create a trackable with a non-zero\nz-coordinate.\n\n\n@patch 1.00\n',
    gamecache:
        '\nGamecaches are designed for transferring data between maps in a campaign, by\nstoring data on the hard disk. In multi-player games however, the data is never\nstored on the hard disk, making online campaigns and saving/loading data between\ngames impossible.\n\nTo be able to read and write from a gamecache across maps you have to use a\nconsistent name between them, that is the first parameter for `InitGameCache`.\nIf you\'re developing a campaign it would be reasonable to use something like\n`set my_gc = InitGameCache("my_campaign.w3v")`.\n\nOnce you\'ve setup your `gamecache` it is time to fill it with data. There are\nonly five natives to store data inside a `gamecache`, that is\n\n* `StoreInteger`\n* `StoreReal`\n* `StoreBoolean`\n* `StoreString`\n* `StoreUnit`\n\nThese should be enough to track stats like gold, lumber and all your important\n`unit`s. Just storing values inside the `gamecache` is not enough to transfer\nthem between maps though; in fact those natives still work in multiplayer.\nPersisting stored values to disk is achieved by calling `SaveGameCache(my_gc)`.\n\nNow if you create your `gamecache` again via `InitGameCache("my_campaign.w3v")`\n(in another map or another game) it should have all previously stored values\navailable and can be queried via `HaveStoredString`, `RestoreUnit`, `GetStoredInteger`, etc.\n\n@patch 1.00\n',

Often (but not\nalways) that is the packet coming from the game host.\n\nMore interesting perhaps is the use to synchronize local data (like a player\'s\ncamera position) to all other players. To do this only store and sync the value\nin a local context:\n\n```\nif GetLocalPlayer() == p then\n    call StoreInteger(my_cache, "missionkey", "key", my_value)\n    call SyncStoredInteger(my_cache, "missionkey", "key")\nendif\n```\n\nNow this will synchronize the local value `my_value` to each player but we don\'t\nknow when each player has actually received it.

To read use `GetPlayerName`.\n\nInside the preload script you can also use `ExecuteFunc` to call your map-defined\nfunctions and interleave the preload script with your functions.\n\n@note If you use `Preloader` to load some values into your map, these values\nare very likely to be different for each player (since the player might not \neven have local files enabled), so treat them as async values.\n\n@note Also see the documentation of `Preload` to see how to properly get the data\ninto the preload script.\n\n@bug 1.33.0 and above: Due to aggressive file caching by the game, the preload file is only loaded and read once.\nThis means, updates to the saved preload file cannot be reloaded and old contents will be executed.\n\n@note See: `Preload`, `PreloadEnd`, `PreloadStart`, `PreloadRefresh`, `PreloadEndEx`, `PreloadGenClear`, `PreloadGenStart`, `PreloadGenEnd`.\n\n@patch 1.00\n",

Icons are different for disabled/enabled abilities.\n\n\n@bug (1.32.10 confirmed) The game counts isDisabled and hideUI internally as integers(?) If you called 5 times "hideUI = true" to hide an icon then you\'ll need to multiple times "hideUI = false" to show it again.
